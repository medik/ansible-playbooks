# ansible-playbooks

I am currently messing around in Ansible, and this repository is a result of it :-)

There are three different roles available:
      * common - this contains the setup for all purposes e.g. eclipse, irssi, chrome, dropbox
      * development-environment - this includes all my programs used to develop software e.g. eclipse, plugins to emacs
      * gaming-desktop - and this contains a number of config files that are needed to run games on Linux such as nvidia drivers and steam
